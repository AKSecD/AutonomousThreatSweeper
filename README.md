The repository provides threat hunting queries for various threats/attacks that can be leveraged directly within the Securonix Snypr platform. For every attack there are two files -
1. SpotterQueries.txt - The file contains spotter queries that can be executed directly in Snypr to hunt for the respective threats.
2. References.txt - The file contains references/links to sources from where the threat intelligence was collected.
